Since this repository contains the code for an Android app published in Google Play, which could include part of your contributions in future updates, we’re required to have agreements with everyone who takes part. This is the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions (in effect, you’re giving us a licence, but you still own the copyright, so you retain the right to modify your code and use it in other projects).
