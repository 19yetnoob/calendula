Core ideas
===========
- Easy prescription input (ideally automatic via barcode or QR scan)
- Alarms and reminders
- Fit user habits and routines
- Simple, user focused, and visually attractive interface ([Take a look at this preview](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/calendula-ui.pdf))

Related goals

- Nearby pharmacies information
