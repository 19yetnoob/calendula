Calendula is an android that allows users to manage their medical prescription through a nice, simple and intuitive interface. Users can easily
define their own daily routines (wake up, lunch, dinner, ...) and then link medication intakes to them.

Core ideas
===========
- Easy prescription input
- Alarms and reminders
- Fit user habits and routines
- Simple, user focused, and visually attractive interface.

Future work
=============
- Medicine stock management and refill warnings
- Gamification concepts to improve prescription adherence
- Trip assistance (how many pills I need for the weekend?)
- Nearby pharmacies information
