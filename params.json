If you want to help developing the app take a look to the contributing section, at the end.\r\n\r\n### Development environment setup\r\n\r\nWe use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) (the official Android IDE) for development, so we recommend it as the IDE to use in your development environment. Once you install Android Studio, you can use the Android SDK Manager to obtain the SDK tools, platforms, and other components you will need to start developing. The most important are:\r\n\r\n * Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform-tools (upgrade to their last versions is usually a good idea).\r\n * Android SDK Build-Tools 24.0.1.\r\n * Android 7.0 (API Level 24) SDK Platform.\r\n * Android Support Repository\r\n\r\nYou can also install other packages like emulators for running the app, if you don't have or don't want to use a real device. The minimum supported Android version is *4.0.1, Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14).*\r\n\r\n### Building and installing the app\r\n\r\nFirst of all you need to get the source code, so clone this repository  on your local machine. If you want to contribute it is better to **fork the repository** by clicking on the *Fork* option on the top right corner and\r\n [keep it synced](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) by adding the original repository as a remote.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/[citiususc|yourgithubusername]/calendula.git\r\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/citiususc/calendula.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio uses Gradle as the foundation of the build system, but It is not necessary that you install it in your pc. You can use the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) included in the project, as recommended by Google. Building the app with\r\nGradle is very easy: in a terminal, go to the directory that contains the repository, and run the `clean` and `build` tasks using the gradle wrapper (you may need to run `chmod +x gradlew` before):\r\n```\r\n./gradlew clean build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, for running the app on a device or emulator:\r\n```\r\nadb [-d] install path/to/calendula.apk\r\n```\r\n*The -d flag specifies that you want to use the attached device (in case you also have an emulator running.*\r\n\r\nThis tasks can also be done from Android Studio with a few clicks.\r\n\r\n## App versions\r\nWe only maintain the Calendula app at Google Play:\r\n\r\n * The latest version of the app available on Google Play reflects the code of the `master` branch.\r\n * Release branches are usually deployed through the *Google Play BETA channel* before they are made available to everyone. If you want to be a member of the testing community, join the testing group on Google Groups, and you will automatically receive the updates from the BETA channel like normal updates from Google Play.\r\n\r\n> Join the  BETA channel: [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/calendula-testing](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/calendula-testing)\r\n\r\nCheck out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info about the branching model.\r\n\r\n## How does it look? ##\r\n\r\nWe try to follow [Material Design](https://material.google.com/#) principles. Take a look at the result!\r\n   \r\n*The screenshots below are taken from the development version (branch `develop`).*\r\n\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/home.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/agenda.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/schedules.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/aviso.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/navdrawer.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4213618/calendula/multipat/profile.png\" width=\"250px\" />\r\n\r\nWe use <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/people-avatars_761436.htm\">this vector pack at Freepik</a> for user avatars.\r\n\r\n## Future work ##\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of development ideas, and we are open to newer ones. Below are some interesting features that could be very useful:\r\n\r\n * Information about nearby pharmacies, their locations and timetables\r\n * Trip assistant (how many pills I need for this weekend?)\r\n * Introducing [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) concepts to improve adherence. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing ##\r\nFeel free to fork and send a pull request if you want to contribute to this project!
